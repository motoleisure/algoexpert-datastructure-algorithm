## Invert Binary Tree
- 题目：Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and invert it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.
- Each **Binary Tree** node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be **Binary Tree** nodes themselves or **Node / null**.

- **Sample Input**
```python
tree = 1
     /   \
    2     3
   /  \  /  \
   4  5  6   7
```
- **Sample Output**
```python
       1
     /   \
    3     2
   /  \  /  \
  7   6  5   4
```
